# This script will update your already installed discord

To use this script first you need to have discord already installed in your system in '/opt' directory. Remember this is a update script not a download script (maybe download aswell in future). 

clone and run this script anywhere you like and it will install latest discord image from discord website in '/tmp' directory and extract its contents. Once the contents are extracted it will be copied to '/opt/Discord/' directory and then you can close the terminal and run discord so that it can update itself.

Any Issue/Suggestions are highly appreciated!
